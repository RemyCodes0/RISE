# üå± RISE - Taxonomy Learning Game

## üìö Introduction
RISE (Revision and Interactive Study Environment) is a gamified application designed to help students in Grade 12 better understand naming in taxonomy. The application allows students to track their improvement while learning key concepts related to taxonomy, preparing them for the GCE Advanced Level exams. The project is built using Django for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend.

## üöÄ Features
- **Gamified Learning:** The app is divided into multiple steps or levels where students can progressively learn and test their understanding of taxonomy.
- **Progress Tracking:** Students can monitor their level of improvement through interactive steps.
- **Backend Focused:** While the application includes a simple frontend interface built with Bootstrap, the main focus of the project is on backend development with Django.
- **Open for Contributions:** The frontend design is simple, and we encourage frontend developers to contribute and enhance the user interface!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Django
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap
- **Database:** Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
